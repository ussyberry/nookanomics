# Contributions

We welcome contributions! This project is open‑source and aims to provide a premium Animal Crossing themed web experience. Follow these steps to get involved:

## Getting the Code

```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nookanomics.git
cd nookanomics
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
   ```
2. **Make your changes** – keep the code style consistent (Prettier, ESLint).
3. **Run the dev server** to test locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Write tests** if applicable and ensure the existing test suite passes:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
5. **Commit** with a clear message and push:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/awesome-feature
   ```

## Pull Request Process

- Open a PR against the `main` branch.
- Provide a concise description of what the PR does.
- Ensure the CI checks pass (build, lint, tests).
- Request a review from the maintainers.

## Code Style & Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** and **React functional components**.
- Follow the existing folder structure (`src/components`, `src/pages`).
- Keep Tailwind classes consistent; prefer utility‑first styling.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Update documentation (README, docs) when adding new features.

## Issues & Feature Requests

- Open an issue with a clear title and description.
- Include screenshots or mockups if relevant.
- Tag the issue appropriately (`bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).
